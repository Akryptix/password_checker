# Password Strength Checker

### Overview
This project is a single-page web application that provides real-time, visual feedback on the strength of a user's password. It's built as a standalone tool to demonstrate fundamental front-end development skills and an understanding of password security principles.

### Key Features
* **Real-time Scoring:** As the user types, a score out of 100 is calculated and displayed instantly.
* **Detailed Feedback:** Individual indicators track whether the password contains uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
* **Algorithmic Logic:** The strength is determined by a score-based algorithm that rewards length and character diversity.
* **Modern UI:** The interface is clean, responsive, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

### Technologies Used
* **HTML:** For the page structure.
* **JavaScript:** All the core application logic is handled in a separate `.js` file.
* **CSS:** Styling is applied using the Tailwind CSS framework via a CDN.
